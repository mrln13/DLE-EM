# DLE-EM: Deep-Learning-Enhanced Electron Microscopy

This is the official repository for the paper Deep-Learning-Enhanced Electron Microscopy for Earth Material Characterization.

## Introduction

The research introduces a Deep Learning (DL) based method to accelerate imaging of rock microstructures by up to 16 times with minimal quality loss.

**Abstract**

Rocks, as Earth materials, contain intricate microstructures that reveal their geological history.
These microstructures include grain boundaries, preferred orientation, twinning and porosity, 
and they hold critical significance in the realm of the energy transition. As they influence the physical strength, 
chemical reactivity, and fluid flow properties of rocks, they also directly impact subsurface reservoirs used for geothermal energy, 
nuclear waste disposal, and hydrogen and carbon dioxide storage. Understanding microstructures, 
and their distribution, is therefore essential for ensuring the stability and effectiveness of these subsurface activities. 
Achieving statistical representativeness often requires the imaging of a substantial quantity of samples at a high level of
magnification. To address this challenge, this research introduces a novel image enhancement process for scanning
electron microscopy datasets, demonstrating the potential for significant resolution improvement through
Deep-Learning-Enhanced Electron Microscopy (DLE-EM). This approach accelerates imaging processes,
up to a factor of 16, with minimal impact on quality and offers possibilities for real-time super-resolution imaging of
unknown microstructures, promising to advance the field of geoscience and material science.
